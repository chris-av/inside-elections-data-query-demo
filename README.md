# Inside Elections Data Query Demo

Just a quick demo I wrote up for querying the data from Inside Elections. Data is in XML format. They are very generous with the data they share. 


Many thanks to the Inside Elections team for providing this data to the public. Read more about the data you can query [here](https://insideelections.com/developer)



## Installation

You don't really install anything. You run it. Make sure to load the virtual environment: 

```sh
python -m venv myenv # call myenv whatever you like
pip install -r requirements.txt # install the dependencies from requirements.txt

python main.py
```

out folder should populate with json and csv files.
